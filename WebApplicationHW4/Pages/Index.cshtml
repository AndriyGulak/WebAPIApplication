    <h1 class="display-4">About me</h1>
    <p>
        I have been in the software development since 2006, working for national and worldwide companies in domains such as media, retail, automotive and insurance. I come from Kyiv and live here with my family of three and a cat. I graduated from the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and got a degree in Computer science.
        Among the area of my professional interests are databases,  DWH, and C# programming language.

        At leisure time I prefer having BBQs with my family and friends, go skiing, cycling and learning new things in the technology world.</a>.
